INTRODUCTION
In Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence (AI) sometimes called machine intelligence, is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and other animals. Computer science defines AI research as the study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals. Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is used to describe machines that mimic "cognitive" functions that humans associate with other human minds, such as "learning" and "problem solving".
Project idea about is a software that reproduces the behavior of a human expert performing an intellectual task in a specific field Using two Algorithm :
- The first Algorithm is : Forward chaining starts with the facts, and sees what rules apply (and hence what should be done) given the facts.
- The second Algorithm is : Backward chaining starts the objective to reach the facts that caused this goal.
